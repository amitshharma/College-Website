            Creative Arts We boast a proven record for creative and scholarly
            outputs of international excellence in the field of the arts.
            Research takes place within the School and in collaboration with UK
            and global research partners, investigating new directions in both
            the creation and the analysis of a wide range of cultural forms.

          Each of the University’s academic schools has distinctive research
          strengths. A key characteristic of the research activity across our
          Loughborough and London campuses is the way in which we apply
          expertise across disciplines, in partnership with a breadth of
          external organisations to create far reaching impact and influence.

            Our research partnerships have also improved the number of sporting
            opportunities for people with disabilities worldwide. Working with
            international partners as well as GB teams, researchers from Oak
            Park's Peter Harrison Centre for Disability Sport have played a
            critical role in shaping new events and rules as well as
            safeguarding the health of Para-athletes.
