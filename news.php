            Oak Park Students’ Union (OPU) Action has recently been recognised
            for its outstanding volunteering contributions to Oak Park and the
            surrounding villages of Charnwood. The initiative – which has been
            running for 25 years – regularly exceeds 10,000 hours’ worth of
            volunteering each academic year, and during the 2021/22 academic
            year there has been over 750 active student volunteers

          Product design student Sri Hollema has created Mat Zero, a
          rechargeable heated mat that can be used as a heating solution for
          refugees around the world.
          <br />
          Sri wanted her final-year project to make an impact on vulnerable
          communities and increase the quality of life for refugees. She
          interviewed staff from the United Nations High Commissioner for
          Refugees (UNHCR) in the early stages of the process to ensure that her
          product would meet the needs of those she wanted to help.
